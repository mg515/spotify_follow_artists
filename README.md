# spotify_follow_artists
A tiny script that reads a list of artists and follows them on spotify.
As I made a transition to the music streaming world, it was useful to have my music library translated onto Spotify. Following artists option is a good way to maintain your library on Spotify and this little script gets you running in no time.
